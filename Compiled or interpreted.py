# Python is a compiled or interpreted language?

# python is both compiled and interpreted language

# python 1st gets compiled into bytecode

# then it is interpred by pvm (python virtual machine)

# interpreted - line by line execution

# converting a high level language into bytecode is for portability

# which means it'll support all kind of cpu

# so python 1st gets compiled to get bytecode and then it gets interpreted by pvm and finally it becomes machine code

# cpython - the actual implementation we did all are cpython

# there are more types of python
# cpython   - the implementation is using c language or the internal work done by c language
# pypy      - pypy is 4.4 faster executing than python. It is implemented by Rpython
# IronPython  - "       "           "     .net language
# jython   -    "       "           "     .java language
